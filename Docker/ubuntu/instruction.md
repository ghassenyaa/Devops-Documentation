Install a VNC Client:
To access the desktop, you'll need a VNC client. There are web-based VNC clients like noVNC, or you can use a standalone VNC client like TightVNC, RealVNC, or others.

Connect to the VNC Server:
Open your VNC client and connect to localhost:5901. When prompted, enter the password you set in the Dockerfile (your_password).

Use Ubuntu Desktop:
Once connected, you should see the Ubuntu desktop environment and be able to interact with it through your VNC client.
